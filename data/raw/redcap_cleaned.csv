By the time I was 5 years old, I was aware of wishing that I could be a girl, and I began to hate my male name - this would plague me my entire life, right up to transition at age 59. All through my teens and 20's, I was in severe depression, which I now know was gender dysphoria. From age 29 to 57, I was happily married in a very convention cis-het marriage, and I was not in gender dysphoria or depression during those years. My wife died in 2013, and within 2 months, I was cross-dressing and in severe dysphoria again, and by the late summer of 2015, I was starting to lose my sense on identity: I didn't know who I was anymore. I joined a trans support group in January 2016, found a therapist in March 2016, and committed to transition on June 4th, 2016. Everything was cleared up by my transition. No more depression, and I have found joy in my life. I have a life-partner again, (another transwoman), my daughter (she is age 40), is 100% supportive and accepting of my transition, and I have actually a much better relationship with her now than I ever did while I was trying to be her ""Dad"". I consider my transgender identity to be truly a gift. I have been able to experience  life on both sides of the gender line, and both phases of my life have mostly been happy."

Assuming that all trans people are gender nonconforming in some way, or that we universally do not pass as the gender we live as, is not only an entirely false assumption, but it'll definitely skew your data toward a certain, small part of the trans community and exclude the majority of trans people who, like me, are binary, cis passing, and gender conforming."

As a trans man who's been on hrt for over a year and has has my legal name changed, passing, though obviously important to me, is no longer a huge fear or worry for me because I know I completely pass now. Before hrt, my worries about passing limited my participation in events outside of my home because I was so fearful of being recognized as trans and the consequences that would follow. I used to be very miserable and low energy because fears of passing, being misgendered, and being harrassed constantly followed me. Now, I no longer have those constant worries floating around me, so I feel a lot happier and more peaceful, thanks to hrt. I hope you are taking experiences like mine into account with this survey."
