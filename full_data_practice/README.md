# Full Data and Practice

These script represent the practice of SEM using *lavaan*. They use the full dataset. The SEM model for the full dataset is not reported because a second project using the full dataset to confirm the factor structure of the GIMS will be created (see lab notebook). 

Note that the code may need path redirects to load properly, although I attempted to redirect all the scripts appropriately.
